\chapter*{Publications}

In this thesis, the content of some chapters is formed from
previously published papers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \citet{DBLP:conf/lopstr/HughesO20} Resourceful Program Synthesis from
    Graded Linear Types. In Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation -
    30th International Symposium, pp. 151-170. 
    
    This paper adapts the resource management techniques of previous work for
    Linear Logic proof search to graded types, and presents two synthesis
    calculi based on these approaches. This paper constitutes the majority of
    Chapter~\ref{chapter:core}, where a program synthesis tool for a linear and
    graded type system is introduced. 

    \item \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2112-14966} Deriving Distributive Laws
    for Graded Linear Types. In 6th edition of the International Workshop on
    Linearity and of the 4th edition of the International Workshop on Trends in
    Linear Logic and its Applications. 

    The majority of Chapter~\ref{chapter:deriving}, which discusses an approach
    for automatically deriving certain graded programs in Granule as an
    alternative to synthesis, is derived from this paper. 
\end{itemize}
