\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}
One of the most useful and well-studied tools available to modern programmers is
the type system. Not only do type systems allow many kinds of errors to be
caught statically, they also help inform the design of a program. Many
programmers will often tend to begin writing their programs by first defining
the types, from which the program code follows naturally. This phenomenon will
be familiar to any who have written programs in typed functional programming
languages, and results from the fact that types form a high-level abstract
specification of program behaviour. 

Type-directed program synthesis is a well-studied technique for automatically
generating program code from a given type specification - the \textit{goal}
type. This approach has a long history, which is deeply intertwined with
automated theorem proving, thanks to the Curry-Howard
correspondence~\cite{manna1980deductive,10.5555/1624562.1624585}. 

One lens through which we can view this task is as an inversion of type
checking: we start with a goal type and inductively synthesise well-typd
sub-terms by breaking the goal into sub-goals, pruning the search space of
programs via typing as we go. This approach follows the treatment of program
synthesis as a form of proof search in logic: given a type $[[ A ]]$ we want to
find a program term $[[ t ]]$ which inhabits $[[ A ]]$. We can express this in
terms of a synthesis \textit{judgement} which acts as a kind of inversion of
typing or proof rules:
% of Gentzen's sequent calculus~\cite{Gentzen1935UntersuchungenD}:
%
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma \vdash [[ A ]] \Rightarrow [[ t ]]
\end{align*}
%
meaning that the term $[[ t ]]$ can be synthesised for the goal type $[[ A ]]$
under a context of assumptions $[[ G ]]$. We may construct a calculus of
synthesis \textit{rules} for a programming language, inductively defining the
above synthesis judgement for each type former. For example, we may define a
rule for standard product types in the following way:
\begin{align*}
  \inferrule*[Right=$\times_{\textsc{Intro}}$]{ \Gamma \vdash [[ A ]] \Rightarrow [[ t1 ]] \\ \Gamma \vdash [[ B ]] \Rightarrow [[ t2 ]]}{ \Gamma \vdash [[ A ]] \times [[ B ]] \Rightarrow ([[ t1 ]], [[t2]] )}
\end{align*}
%
Reading `clockwise' from the bottom-left: to synthesise a value of type $A
\times B$, we synthesise a value of type $A$ and then a value of type $B$ and
combine them into a pair in the conclusion. The `ingredients' for synthesising
the subterms $[[ t1 ]]$ and $[[ t2 ]]$ come from the free-variable assumptions
$[[ G ]]$ and any constructors of $A$ and $B$, assuming these types are
monomorphic.

Depending on the context, there could be many possible combinations of
assumption choices to synthesise such a pair. Consider the following partial
program containing a program \emph{hole}, marked with $?$, specifying a position
at which we wish to perform synthesis:
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{ll}
    f : A \rightarrow A \rightarrow A \rightarrow A \times A &
    \\
    f\ x\ y\ z =\ ? &
\end{array}
\end{align*}
The function has three parameters all of type $A$ which can be used to
synthesise an expression of the goal type $A \times A$. Expressing this
synthesis problem as an instantiation of the above $\times_{\textsc{Intro}}$
rule:
%
\begin{align*}
  \inferrule*[Right=$\times_{\textsc{Intro}}$]
  { [[ x : A , y : A , z : A ]] \vdash [[ A ]] \Rightarrow [[ t1 ]]
 \\ [[ x : A, y : A, z : A ]] \vdash [[ A ]] \Rightarrow [[ t2 ]]}
  { [[ x : A, y : A, z : A ]] \vdash [[ A ]] \times [[ A ]] \Rightarrow ([[ t1 ]] , [[ t2 ]]) }
\end{align*}
%
Even in this simple setting, the number of possibilities starts to become
unwieldy: there are nine ($3^2$) possible candidate programs based on
combinations of $x$, $y$ and $z$. Ideally, we would like some way of
constraining the number of choices that are required by the synthesis algorithm.
Many systems achieve this by allowing the user to specify additional information
about their desired program behaviour. For example, recent work has extended
type-directed synthesis to refinement types~\citep{10.1145/2908080.2908093}, cost
specifications~\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1904-07415}, differential
privacy~\citep{diffprivacysynthesis}, example-guided
synthesis~\citep{10.1145/2813885.2737977,DBLP:conf/cav/AlbarghouthiGK13} or
examples integrated with types~\citet{frankle2016example,oseraMYTH1}, and
ownership information~\citep{fiala2023leveraging}. The general idea is that, with
more information, whether that be richer types, additional examples, or
behavioural specifications, the proof search / program synthesis process can be
pruned and refined.


This work presents a program synthesis approach that leverages the information
contained in \emph{linear} and \emph{graded type systems} that track and enforce
program properties related to data flow, statically. We refer to these systems
as \emph{resourceful} type systems, since they treat data as though it is a
physical resource, constraining how data can be used by a program and thus
reducing the number of possible synthesis choices that need to be made. Our
hypothesis is that resource-and-type-directed synthesis speeds up type-directed
synthesis, reducing the number of paths that need to be explored and the amount
of additional specification (e.g. input-output examples) required.

Graded type systems trace their roots to linear logic. In linear logic, data is
treated as though it were a finite resource which must be consumed exactly once
with arbitrary copying and discarding disallowed~\citep{girard1987linear}.
Non-linear use of data is expressed through the $!$ modal operator (the
\emph{exponential modality}). This gives a binary view---a value may either be
used exactly once or in a completely unconstrained way. Bounded Linear Logic
(BLL) refines this view, replacing ! with a family of indexed modal operators
where the index provides an upper bound on usage~\citep{girard1992bounded},
e.g., $!_{\leq 4}A$ represents a value $A$ which may be used up to 4 times. In
recent years, various works have generalised BLL, resulting in \textit{graded}
type systems in which these indices are drawn from an arbitrary pre-ordered
semiring~\citep{DBLP:conf/esop/BrunelGMZ14,DBLP:conf/esop/GhicaS14,petricek2014coeffects,DBLP:journals/pacmpl/AbelB20,DBLP:journals/pacmpl/ChoudhuryEEW21,quantitative-type-theory,McBride2016}.
This allows numerous program properties to be tracked and enforced statically,
including various kinds of reuse, privacy and confidentiality, and capabilities.
Such systems are increasingly popular and form the basis of Linear
Haskell~\citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/BernardyBNJS18}, Idris
2~\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2104-00480}, as well as the experimental
programming language Granule~\citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/OrchardLE19}.

Returning to our example in a graded setting, the arguments of the function now
have \emph{grades} (annotations) that, in this context, are natural numbers
describing the exact number of times the parameters must be used (the choice
here was ours):
%
\begin{align*}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    f : A^{2} \rightarrow A^{0} \rightarrow A^{0} \rightarrow A \times A &
    \\
    f\ x\ y\ z =\ ? &
  \end{array}
\end{align*}
The first $A$ is annotated with a grade $2$, which in this context indicates that it
\textit{must} be used twice. Likewise, the types of $y$ and $z$
are graded with $0$, enforcing zero usage, i.e., we are not allowed
to use them in the body of $f$ and must discard them.

The result is that there is only one (normal form) inhabitant for this type: $[[
(x, x) ]]$; the other assumptions will not even be considered in synthesis,
allowing us to effectively prune out branches which use resources in a way which
violates the grades. In this example, these annotations take the form of natural
numbers explaining how many times a value can be used, but we may instead wish
to represent different kinds of program properties, such as sensitivity,
strictness, or security levels for tracking non-interference, all of which are
well-known instances of graded type
systems~\citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/OrchardLE19,DBLP:conf/icfp/GaboardiKOBU16,DBLP:journals/pacmpl/AbelB20}.
Note that all of these examples are technically graded presentations of
\emph{coeffects}, tracking how a programs uses its context, in contrast with
graded types for side
\emph{effects}~\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/OrchardPM14,DBLP:conf/popl/Katsumata14},
which we do not consider here.


\section{Contributions}
The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility and power of
using resourceful types as the basis of a type-directed program synthesis tool,
culminating in the development and implementation of an expressive, efficient,
and feature-rich program synthesis tool for the program language
Granule~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/OrchardLE19}. Granule is a functional
programming language which combines linear, graded, and indexed data types;
although we concern ourselves only with the former two in this work. 

Specifically, this work makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We identify two approaches which make type-directed program synthesis in
        a resourceful setting feasible. Drawing inspiration from the work of
        Hodas and Miller on theorem proving~\citep{HODAS1994327}, we adapt their
        method to graded types, and propose a dual approach, yielding two
        strategies for managing the usage of values as resources in the
        synthesis of a program term. 

  \item We use these approaches to construct two simple synthesis calculi for a
        simplified core of Granule, which demonstrate their effectiveness as
        tools for resourceful program synthesis. We implement both approaches as 
        part of the Granule toolchain. 

  \item We showcase an alternative and complementary approach to generating a
        subset of Granule programs, making use of a system inspired by Haskell's
        deriving mechanism~\cite{generic-deriving} adapted to graded types.

  \item We then define a synthesis calculus for a fully graded type system. This
        type system is a feature-rich language based on Granule's \emph{graded
        base} language extension, which includes recursion, recursive types, and
        user-defined ADTs. Furthermore, we again implement this calculus as part
        of the Granule toolchain.

  \item We evaluate our tool on a benchmark suite of recursive functional
        programs leveraging standard data types like lists, streams, and trees.
        We compare against non-graded synthesis provided by
        \textsc{Myth}~\citep{oseraMYTH1}.

  \item We prove that each of these systems is sound, i.e., synthesised programs
        are typed by the goal type. A ket property here is that synthesised programs 
        are not well-typed, but also \emph{well-resourced}, meaning that all values  
        inside the program are used according to their resource constraints. We
        show that this property holds for each of our synthesis calculi as part
        of their soundness proofs. 

  \item We demonstrate how our approach to resourceful program synthesis can be
        readily applied to other graded systems. Leveraging our calculus and
        implementation, we provide a prototype tool for synthesising Haskell
        programs written using GHC 9's linear types extension.
\end{itemize}
\section{Structure}

This dissertation is structured into six chapters. In the next chapter,
Chapter~\ref{chapter:background}, the theoretical background of linear and
graded types is laid out. In doing so, we introduce two core calculi with simple
types and grades, which demonstrate the two major lineages of resourceful type
systems. The first is a language based on an underlying non-graded type system
(in this case a linear type system), with graded modal types introduced and
eliminated explicitly. This system is the default basis of
Granule~\citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/OrchardLE19}, the target language of our
implementation. The second caculus does away with this linear basis, embedding
graded modalities into the function types a la Idris 2 and Linear Haskell.
McBride's QTT~\citep{McBride2016,quantitative-type-theory}, the core of Linear
Haskell~\citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/BernardyBNJS18}, and the unified graded
modal calculus of \citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/AbelB20}. This system is also 
present in Granule in the form of an optional language extension.

The rest of the dissertation is structured such that synthesis calculi for both
of these systems are defined and presented, minimising any redundancy in the
presentation. Despite the variances between the core calculi
of~\ref{chapter:background}, there is a substantial degree of overlap between
the two. Thus, we adopt the following structure: 
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:core} introduces the core concepts of
        type-directed program synthesis from resourceful type systems using an
        extenion of the typing calculus of section~\ref{sec:linear-base}.
        Specifically this chapter introduces the \textit{resource management
        problem} as it relates to program synthesis: how do we ensure that a
        synthesised program is not only well-typed but also
        well-resourced? To address this question, we define two calculi
        of synthesis rules based on the graded linear $\lambda$-calculus which
        tackle the problem in different ways. To better illustrate and test the
        practicality of the synthesis calculi, we extend the language with
        multiplicative conjunction (product types $\otimes$ and unit $1$) and
        additive disjunction (sum types $\otimes$). These calculi are then
        implemented targeting deafult Granule.

        We produce a comparative evaluation of the implemented synthesis tool, 
        contrasting the resource management approaches against each other, before 
        selecting the most performant to use going forward.  

        \item We then make a brief diversion from type-directed synthesis,
        exploring a mechanism for automatically deriving programs from their
        type à la Haskell's generic deriving mechanism~\cite{generic-deriving}.
        Again for this we base the approach on the graded linear
        $\lambda$-calculus, extending it further with data constructors, pattern
        matching, and recursive data types.
        \item Finally, in chapter~\ref{chapter:extended}, we present a synthesis
        calculus for a target language based instead on the core graded
        $\lambda$-calculus of~\ref{sec:graded-base}. This calculus incorporates
        all of the language features that have been introduced in the previous chapters,
        for a rich synthesis tool implementation targeting Granule's
        \emph{graded base} language extension. Furthermore, we outline several other useful 
        extensions to the synthesis tool, such as the inclusion of example-based synthesis,
        and a post-synthesis refactoring process which re-writes synthesised programs in 
        a more idiomatic style.

        We then evaluate the implementation on a set of 46 benchmarks, including
        several non-trivial programs which make use of these new features. In this
        evaluation, we compare to From our evaluation we find that using grades in
        synthesis outperforms purely type-driven program synthesis in terms of both
        speed, number of input-output examples required or number of retries to get the
        desired program.
        
        Finally, to demonstrate the practicality and versatility of our approach, we
        apply our synthesis algorithm of Chapter~\ref{chapter:extended} to synthesising
        programs in Haskell from type signatures using GHC's \emph{linear types}
        extension (which is implemented underneath by a graded type system).

\end{enumerate}


This approach strikes a balance between maximising coverage of different
approaches to resourceful type systems, and avoiding uneccessary repetition,
whilst gradually increasing the complexity of the target language. By the end, we
will then have two synthesis tool implementations for Granule, targeting both
styles of graded type systems.
