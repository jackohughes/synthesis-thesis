% The UoK class file extends the standard report style to follow the Registry
% guidelines for laying out a thesis. It sets the margins, interline spacing,
% the page, figure and table numbering style, and disallows page breaks at
% hyphens. The class file consists of setting one and an half line spacing text
% with a 4cm left margin, at least a 2.5cm right margin, approximately 2cm top
% and bottom margin, on A4 paper.
% 
% The class the following options, in addition to those of the standard report
% class.
%     mini - Toggles the thesis in to mini-thesis mode. This adds "mini" to the
%            title and appends a nocite(*) at the end for an automatic output of
%            your complete bibliography.
%     draftmark - Puts a DRAFT' watermark on every page of the document along
%                 with the draft statement on the title page. Additionaly, it
%                 is used as a switch for the UoKExtentions package.
%     draft - Puts the entire document into draft mode. Applies all the effect
%             of draftmark above, but also propergates to other packages used.
%     copyright - Adds a copyright page between the title page and the preface.
%     nofig - Disables output of the list of figures in the preface.
%     notab - Disables output of the list of tables in the preface.
%     noalgo- Disables output of the list of algorithms in the preface.
% All options passed to UoKthesis will be passed along to included packages:
%    natbib, draftwatermark, setspace, hyperref, lmodern
%
% The cover page and optional copyright page are implicitly added before the
% start of the preface section. Use the following commands to populate the 
% cover page/copyright page information:
%     \title{thesis title}
%     \author{author's name} 
%     \degree{Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, etc.} 
%     \subject{author's department}
%          - Computer Science if omitted 
%     \submitdate{month year in which submitted}
%          - dated by LaTeX if omitted 
%     \copyrightyear{year degree conferred (next year if submitted in Dec.)}
%          - assumes current year (or next year, in December) if omitted 
% 
% The preface environment allows for the use of sections that precede the main
% document; such as Abstract and  Acknowlegements. These sections should be
% defined using \section{Preface Section Title}. The contents page (and list of
% figures and tables if in use) will be automatically inserted at the end of the
% preface environment.
%
% The thesis style invokes the setspace package to set the commands:
%     \doublespace
%     \onehalfspace
%     \singlespace
% for spacing. By default one and an half spacing is used which resembles the
% UKC Typewriter requirement. Singlespace can be used for letterpress
% appearance. If you want to use true double space, for some reason, place the
% \doublespace command where you want to start using double spacing. Just call
% the appropriate spacing command at where you want to use them.
% 
% In the figure and table environments, single spacing is used. If you want to
% use any other size rather than one and an half spacing, then do:
% 	\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.6} (or whatever you want instead of 1.6)
% This command won't take effect unless it comes before the \begin{document} or
% is triggered by a font change (after something like \small \normalsize).
%
% The example below shows the 12pt thesis style being used. This seems to give
% acceptable looking results, but it may be omitted to get 10pt. Alternatively,
% the 11pt option can be used.
%
% This version differs from old_ukcthesis.sty in the following ways:
% 1. Removed the doublespace package (now uses setspace).
% 2. Merged the phantom section for correct PDF links into the bibliography
%    generating function. 
% 3. Added thesis type options (mini, draft).
% 4. Kent Harvard is used for referencing and citation, this is supported by the
%    natbib package.
% 5. PsFig macro removed.
% 6. Now comes as two files, UoKthesis.cls, which defines purely stylistic layout,
%    and UoKextentions.sty, that provideds some additional functionality.

\documentclass[12pt,mini]{UoKthesis}

% Note: The UoKextentions package includes the xcolor package with the [usenames]
% options. If you need to add further options, these can be given to UoKextentions
% to be propogated through.
